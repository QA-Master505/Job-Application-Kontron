# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optimized Playwright CI for GitHub Actions
# - Runs on push/PR to main/master
# - Installs only Chromium (saves time & space)
# - Keeps job under 20 minutes for free plan

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest         # Use latest Ubuntu runner
    timeout-minutes: 20            # Auto-fail if job exceeds 20 minutes (saves credits)

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1           # Shallow clone for speed (no full history)

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js with caching
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: lts/*      # Use latest active LTS version
          cache: npm               # Cache npm dependencies between runs

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci --no-audit     # Clean install, skip audit (saves time)

      # Step 4: Install ONLY Chromium browser + OS deps
      - name: Install Playwright Chromium
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

      # Step 5: Run Playwright tests (Chromium only)
      - name: Run Playwright tests (Chromium only)
        run: npx playwright test

      # Step 6: Upload report if tests fail
      - name: Upload HTML Report (on failure)
        if: failure() && !cancelled()          # Only if job failed
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-failure-report      # Artifact name
          path: playwright-report/             # Upload HTML report folder
          retention-days: 2                    # Keep for 2 days only (saves storage)
          compression-level: 0                 # Faster upload, no heavy compression
